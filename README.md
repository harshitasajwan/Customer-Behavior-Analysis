# 📊 End-to-End Data Analysis Project (Python | SQL | Power BI)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **data analysis workflow**, starting from raw CSV data and ending with **interactive Power BI dashboards**.  
The goal of this project is to showcase practical skills in **data cleaning, transformation, database handling, SQL querying, and data visualization**.

The entire process mirrors a real-world data analyst workflow where data moves across multiple tools before insights are generated.

---

## 🧩 Dataset Workflow
The project follows these key stages:

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Initial Exploration
- Loaded raw CSV data into **Jupyter Notebook**
- Performed exploratory analysis using **Pandas**
- Analyzed rows and columns side-by-side using **Excel** for validation and understanding data patterns

---

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python – Pandas)
Key preprocessing steps included:
- Converted column names to **snake_case** for consistency
- Divided customers into **age groups** for better segmentation
- Identified **null values** and replaced them with the **median of the same category** to preserve data accuracy
- Performed **frequency mapping** on shopping behavior
- Removed **unnecessary and redundant columns**
- Ensured the dataset was analysis-ready and structured

---

### 3️⃣ Database Integration
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into:
  - **PostgreSQL**
  - **MySQL (MySQL Workbench)**
- Designed tables and verified schema consistency
- Ensured smooth data transfer from Python to relational databases

---

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis
Solved multiple analytical queries using SQL, including:
- Aggregations and group-based analysis
- Filtering and conditional logic
- Business-oriented questions derived from the dataset
- Cross-verification of insights before visualization

---

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Imported the cleaned dataset into **Power BI**
- Built interactive and insight-driven dashboards using:
  - 📊 Bar Charts
  - 🥧 Pie Charts
  - 📋 List Slicers
  - 📈 Clustered Bar Charts
- Designed visuals to highlight trends, comparisons, and category-based insights
- Focused on clarity, usability, and storytelling with data
